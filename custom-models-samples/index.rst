Custom Models: Samples
======================

This page contains a list of custom models that has been trained and made publicly available by other DeepStack users and the DeepStack team. 

You can use any of the models listed below to detect the corresponding objects it is trained for. All you need to do is download the custom model's **.pt** file and deploy it as `detailed here <https://docs.deepstack.cc/custom-models/deployment>`_.

You can also contribute models you have trained by creating an issues on the `DeepStack's GitHub repository <https://github.com/johnolafenwa/deepstack>`_ and include the following in the issue's description

   - purpose of the custom model
   - object(s) that can be detected
   - link to the **.pt** file of the model.
   - link to a GitHub repository or post on the model [optional]
